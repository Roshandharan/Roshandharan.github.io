# Roshan Dharan — Enhanced Portfolio (Static, GitHub Pages Ready)

This ZIP contains an upgraded, responsive, accessible portfolio site designed to work **without any build step**.  
It is suitable for **GitHub Pages** (including `username.github.io`) and will run by simply opening `index.html`.

## What’s improved

- Modern visual system (dark/light theme toggle with persistence)
- Mobile-first navigation with an accessible menu
- SEO upgrades: Open Graph tags, JSON-LD, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`
- Scroll reveal animations (no libraries)
- Projects: search, filter pills, and sorting (most recent / oldest / name)
- Image lightbox for projects, awards, and publications
- Included placeholder assets so nothing looks “broken” out of the box

## Quick start (GitHub Pages)

1. Copy the contents of this ZIP into your repository root.
2. Commit and push to GitHub.
3. In **Settings → Pages**:
   - If this is a **user site** (`username.github.io`), deploy from `main` / root.
   - If this is a **project site**, deploy from `main` / `/docs` (optional).  
     If you deploy as a project site, ensure paths remain correct (this site uses relative paths already).

## Updating content

- **Profile image**: replace `assets/profile.jpg`
- **Resume**: replace `assets/Roshan_Dharan_Resume.pdf`
- **Logos / project images / award images**: replace the corresponding files in `assets/`

The HTML pages are standard and easy to edit:
- `index.html`
- `experience.html`
- `projects.html`
- `publications.html`
- `certifications.html`
- `awards.html`
- `resume.html`

## Keyboard shortcuts

- On the Projects page, press `/` to focus the search box.

## Notes

- The email link is currently a placeholder. If you want a “copy email” button, add your email and I can wire it in.
- All assets are local and work with GitHub Pages.
